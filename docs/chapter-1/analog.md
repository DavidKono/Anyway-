Before we talk about computers lets talk about what they replaced in the olden days.  
Lets use radio as an example.  
First a microphone vibrates with sound waves which generates a changing magnetic field/electrical signal. This is a completely analog process.  

Now usually this electrical signal is used to modulate a high frequency carrier wave which is itself generated by an osscilator which then travels through the air and is picked up by a receiver tuned to that frquency which again generates an electical signal to drive the speakers.  

Lets simplify it even more. Lets say we have the input diaphragm i.e. the microphone connected by a wire to a faraway output diaphragm i.e. the speakers. This is a completely analog process
