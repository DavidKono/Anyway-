We have disccused already that we will be using transistors to build our logic, so lets briefly talk more about them.

BJT
Bipolar junction transistors.
These were popular very early on for their simplicity to manufacture and good gain.
They are made of a Base Collector and Emittor.
A small current flowing through the base controls a larger current between the collector and emitter. This essentially amplifies the inputs.  
This small current must be supplied to keep the current flowing even for a steady output.

(MOS)FETs 
FETs have a Gate Source and Drain.
The MOS in MOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor and is in reference to the MOSCAP (MOS-capacitor).
A voltage is applied to the gate to create an electric field that charges or discharges the capacitor to allow/prevent flow between the source and drain depending on the type of MOSFET.

NMOS and PMOS. 
MOSFETS can be positively or negatively doped (n-type and p-type) 

NMOS (negative MOS) is 




CMOS
