# Introduction

TLDR
This is a book about computers not programming.
This book is for new students/people studying for interview.
Structure of the book.

Introductions are boring... let's be quick!

After finishing my fourth year of my computer engineering degree I was left with one question - "Is that it?!"

I decided that could learn much much more about the beautiful subject of computation - but first I would have to brush up on my fundamentals.

This book is the fruit of studying for job interviews. I wanted to turn rote learning into a deep and interesting understanding for myself - and hopefully you too.

I imagine one of the reasons that computer programming appeals so much to the neurodivergent is that - aside from an escape from reality - it is built upon patterns. Layers and layers of abstraction yield the same patterns. As above, so below.

Computer software and hardware are built on sets of defined rules, but these rules are things that people like you and I decided on. If these rules are intelligent at all we should be able to derive them ourselves. By doing this we can gain a deep understanding of why things are done the way they are, and if it turns out that something can be done better then you might just make yourself a millionaire

I want to write about these patterns of abstraction in one contiguous text - where possible. This will be difficult because it would be a gross simplification to say that only the lower levels influence the higher levels, becauses of course it goes the other way back down as well. 

This book will begin with the bare fundamentals - honestly quite abstracted from "real" computer engineering. There is the oppurtunity for this to be rote learning, but this is computing, there is a logic to this subject to be understood and patterns to be applied!

These are the things you learn in college but don't understand the practicality of until you start working. If you never work in some fields you may think this information not applicable, but if you love this subject why exclude any of its subsections?

How can I write a book about computing without defining my architecture?

My principle for this book is to discuss each individual topic in roughly this order: 

1. The motivation. 

2. The explanation.

3. A definition. This is the rote learning you should be able to repeat word for word if asked it in an interview. No stuttering or even thinking about it required.
4. An example where applicable.

These are each as important as each other
