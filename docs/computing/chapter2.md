## Memory

Byte means the smallest accessible portion of memory. It does not have to mean 8 - but it does. WHy?
Really it should be arbitrary right? 

Really - convention

## The Turing Machine


## Instructions



# Binary code


Single-core single-thread 
Nope

Superscalar and out-of-order execution
Multiple execution units per core. Can performn multiple instructions in same cycle for a thread.

Simultaneous multithreading  
Single core can interleave instructions from multiple thread in same cycle
Depends on workload - obviously can't use same execution unit at once.

Multi-core - each core execute instruction each cycle for assigned thread(s)
