# Anyway - everything about COMPUTErs!

*Written for my younger brother Daniel who I hope will learn a lot from reading this.*

*In dedication to Terry Davis, who created a program so that he might find God, and in turn inspired me in my programming journey. I hope you found Him.*

THIS BOOK IS HEAVILY UNDER CONSRUCTION

I estimate it currently covers about 5% of the final information, and is currently in its first unedited draft - i.e. this is currently a scattered collection of my thoughts.

I have made it publicly available to give myself a bit of motivation to keep working on it everyday, but for now: notes are everywhere, text is unformatted, and placeholder images exist where I will eventually put my own.
